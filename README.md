# 🦀 Oxidised Gear

Welcome to Oxidised Gear, my Rust learning playground! 🎓🚀

## What's This All About?

Oxidised Gear is my journey through the fascinating world of Rust programming. It's a collection of code snippets, examples, and mini-projects that I've created while learning this powerful systems programming language.

Think of it as my "Rust diary" - a place where I experiment, make mistakes, and gradually become more proficient with Rust's unique features and idioms.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Document my Rust learning process
2. Experiment with Rust's key concepts
3. Build a reference for future Rust projects
4. Share my learning journey with others
5. Maybe inspire other Rust newbies along the way!

## 🗂 What's Inside?

- **Basic Examples**: Simple code snippets demonstrating Rust fundamentals
- **Advanced Examples**: More complex concepts like closures, generics, and lifetimes
- **Error Handling**: Various approaches to handling errors in Rust
- **Concurrency**: Adventures in Rust's thread-safe programming
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures
- **Algorithms**: Classic algorithms reimagined in Rust

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is constantly evolving as I learn more about Rust. Expect frequent updates, refactors, and possibly some creative variable naming! 😉

## 🤔 Why "Oxidised Gear"?

Well, Rust is all about preventing system decay, right? So I thought, what's cooler than a well-oiled machine? An oxidised gear that's still running smoothly! Plus, it sounds like a cool band name. 🎸

## 🤝 Contribute
