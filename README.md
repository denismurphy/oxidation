# 🦀 Oxidised Gear

Rust learning and ramblings!

## What's This All About?

Oxidised Gear is a collection of code snippets and examples that I've created while learning rust programming language.

Think of it as a place where I experiment, make mistakes, and gradually maybe more proficient with Rust and it idioms.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Learning and rambling
2. Experiment with Rust

## 🗂 What's Inside?

- **Basic**: Simple code snippets demonstrating Rust fundamentals
- **Advanced**: More complex concepts like closures, generics, and lifetimes
- **Error Handling**: Various approaches to handling errors in Rust
- **Concurrency**: Adventures in Rust's thread-safe programming
- **Data Structures**: Implementations of common data structures
- **Algorithms**: Classic algorithms reimagined in Rust

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is constantly evolving as I learn more about Rust.

## 🤔 Why "Oxidised Gear"?

Oxidised gear that's still running smoothly!
